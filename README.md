# Data-Storytelling-2026

Greetings students! Welcome to the official repository for the Data Storytelling course of 2026. This repository contains all the necessary slides, code, readings, data, and other resources you'll need to excel in this course.

**Note:** Assignments will still be submitted via Canvas, but all coding-related course materials will be hosted here for easy access.

## Reason for using GitHub

Using a GitHub repository for this course offers several advantages:
- **Version Control**: Easily track changes to course materials and access previous versions if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Git is a useful tool that facilitates code collaboration among peers.
- **Accessibility**: Access course materials from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:
- `slides/`: Contains all lecture slides in PDF format.
- `code/`: Contains code examples and scripts used in lectures and assignments.
- `readings/`: Contains supplementary reading materials and articles.
- `data/`: Contains datasets used in class coding activities and projects. (Note: Large datasets (>100 MB) may be hosted externally and linked here.)

## Getting Started with Git

### Using GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a user-friendly application that allows you to interact with GitHub repositories without needing to use the command line. It provides a graphical interface for cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates.

To get started with GitHub Desktop, follow these steps:
1. Download and install GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Clone (i.e., get a copy) this repository to your local machine using GitHub Desktop using this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) as a reference.

Using GitHub Desktop:
- For the course GitHub repository, you will be cloning the repository to access course materials. You won't need to make changes to the repository itself.
- If you are editing code or files from this repository locally, I suggest you move the changed files to a different branch or folder to avoid any conflicts with the main course materials.
- This isn't Dropbox/OneDrive/iCloud! Getting updates doesn't happen automatically. Regularly pull updates from the repository to ensure you have the latest materials.

### (Optional) Using GitHub via the command line

If you are feeling very brave, you can try interacting with GitHub using its command line utility `gh`. It has the advantage of being much lighter weight, programmable, and faster than a general user interface (GUI) like Github Desktop.

**Note:** using the GitHub cli is *not* required for this course, but I included it anyways for those interested in streamlining their workflow.

GitHub has a guide to install `gh` for Windows, MacOS, and Linux [here](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Once installed, you need to activate it, which you can do in your terminal (the terminal in MacOS or [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-US&gl=US)) using the following command:

`gh auth login`

Follow the instructions that follow. I find activating your account with the browser to be the easiest approach.

Once that's done you can clone repositories using the following command:

`gh repo clone [user/reponame]`

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions about the course content or need help with GitHub, please feel free to reach out during office hours, via email, or post in the course discussion forum on Canvas.

Happy coding and storytelling!
